Class 1 - Desenvolvimento bÃ¡sico
  Superset do JavaScript, open source, develop by Microsoft. Today the people can use TypeScript to see
  the errors before to execute the code, because of typing for some variable. Number, String, etc.
  How the works TypeScript?
    The browser can`t run TypeScript, so begin the develop, it necessary to tranpilate the code to JS code.
  How works prototipe?
    In Js the objects are created by functions or constructors, and prototype are equal as a model, when we
    are created an object, are inherited all the structure of prototype. The diffs of TS vs JS are used the
    typing to the same structure.

  Benefits:
    - Static typing 
      -> helps to avoid conflits and programming errors since the begin of development.
    - Validation in time of execution
      -> At the moment of tranpiler, TypeScript validate all the code, and in error case, it inform the file
         and the line that are ocorring the problem.

      It provide recourses with Autocomplete, detected errors in real time, suggest code.
    3. Greater scalability:
      As the projects growing, TypeScript turns natural because the static typing. It's turn easier to keep
      the clean and extends the code.
    4. Facility in refactor:
